# Goodreaders

For educational purposes only. I selected a list of the best female authors on the website Goodreaders.com, and with the help of the Python code provided, I extracted the names and authors of the books from this list.The script uses the requests library to fetch HTML content from each page, BeautifulSoup for parsing, and SQLite for data storage. Each page of the list is iterated through using a loop, where the script sends a GET request to retrieve the page content, extracts relevant information using BeautifulSoup, and inserts the book titles and authors into the books table of a SQLite database. To simulate human-like behavior and avoid overwhelming the server, a random pause between 10 to 20 seconds is introduced after each page request using time.sleep(random.randint(10, 20)).
